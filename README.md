# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

    cd my-slider-app
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Your app will be available at [http://localhost](http://localhost).

4. **Build for Production:**

    When you're ready to deploy, run:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will generate the production-ready files in the `dist` folder.

---

## Usage

The slider component is modular and can be easily integrated into your projects. You can customize the auto-slide interval, transition styles, and content directly within the component files in the `src` folder.

---

## Integration with PHP/MySQLi

To integrate this React slider with a PHP/MySQLi website:

1. **Build the React App:**  
   Run `npm run build` to generate the production package in the `dist` folder.

2. **Upload Production Files:**  
   Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your web server (or a subdirectory, e.g., `/react-app/`).

3. **Embed in Your PHP Page:**

    Include the generated CSS and JS files in your PHP template. For example:

    ```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>My PHP Site with React Slider</title>
        <!-- Adjust paths as necessary -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/react-app/assets/index-<hash>.css">
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
        <script type="module" src="/react-app/assets/index-<hash>.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

    **Note:** Replace `<hash>` with the actual hashed filenames generated by Vite. Adjust the asset paths based on your deployment.
